				<h1>Slieve Donard </h1>
				<p>Slieve Donard is the highest peak in Northern Ireland and is part of the Mourne Mountains, a mountain range in the Southeast of Northern Ireland.
				Slieve Donard is only 850 meters (2,790 ft.) high, but for climbing the peak you need to climb every single vertical meter, since the ascent starts literally at sea level: at Newcastle Beach.
				Climbing Slieve Donard is rather easy, a well-marked trail leads all the way to the summit from the starting point in Newcastle. The route is graded T2 with a few passages of T3. The trail leads through dense forests and along many small streams.
				About halfway up, the dense forest makes place for  the typical Irish Highlands: wet, grassy slopes with boulders covered by mosses; a sign of the wet climate.
				Slieve Donard is a very popular mountain for local people as well as tourists. The views from the summit are great. On clear days you can see as far as Belfast (30 miles to the North) as well as Dublin (55 miles to the south). Towards the east you have tremendous views over the Irish Sea, which is only a couple of miles away from the summit.
				Towards the West you can see all of the other rugged peaks of the Mourne mountains, with Slieve Commedagh (767 m. /2,516 ft.), the second highest peak in Northern Ireland, dominating the view. Slieve Donard has three subsidiary peaks on the seaward side: Millstone Mountain, Thomas's Mountain and Crossone.
				Slieve Donard is mostly climbed from the North  (from Newcastle). Another route starts in the east at Bloody Bridge, where the bloody bridge river enters the Irish Sea. This route follows the river for a large part of the route.  At the ‘’Bog of Donard’’, the saddle between Slieve Donard and Rocky Mountain, the route follows the Mourne Wall, a large stone wall built in the early 20th century, to the summit.
				On the summit you will find the remains of a prehistoric cairn. The Cairn measures 36 metres from north to south, 43m from east to west, and is 1m high. It appears to have been a Neolithic passage tomb, dating to a stunning 3000B.C. It is the highest known passage tomb in Britain and Ireland.

					<h1 id="accordionhead_1">The Glen River Route</h1>
					<div id="accordioncontent_1" class="accordion-content">
						The most common route to the summit of Slieve Donard starts at Newcastle. It is named the Glen river path, because it follows the river up the mountain. You keep heading up the valley trough the dense forest. At about 350 meters above sea level the forest abruptly stops and the landscape immediately changes into the typical Irish Highlands. Without the cover of the trees, you are exposed to the elements: Strong winds and/or heavy rain are very common here.
						Keep heading up the mountain along the Glen River. Eventually you will reach the saddle between Slieve Commedagh and Slieve Donard. At this point you have reached the famous Mourne Wall.
						Follow the wall towards the east up to the summit of Slieve Donard.
					</div>

					<!-- accordion section 2 -->
					<h1 id="accordionhead_2">The Bloody Bridge River Route</h1>
					<div id="accordioncontent_2" class="accordion-content">
						The bloody bridge parking lot is the starting point for this route. Head towards the west. The trail follows the bloody bridge river up the eastern slopes of Slieve Donard. Keep heading west until you reach Crannoge, a very small village consisting of a couple of houses only. After passing Crannoge, you will soon arrive at the ‘’Bog of Donard’’, the saddle between Slieve Donard and Rocky Mountain.
						From this point, the route follows the Mourne Wall, a large stone wall built in the early 20th century, to the summit.<br/>
						Slieve Donard Height: 850m <br/>
						Duration: 9.2km return/4-5 hours<br/>
						Good for: Less experienced hikers who want a shorter walk but still be rewarded with great views

				<h1>Carrauntoohil</h1>
				<p>Carrauntoohil or Carrauntoohill is the highest mountain on the island of Ireland at 1,038.6 metres (3,407 feet 6 inches). It is on the Iveragh Peninsula in the Reeks District in County Kerry, close to the centre of Ireland's highest mountain range, MacGillycuddy's Reeks. Carrauntoohil is composed mainly of sandstone, whose glaciation produced distinctive features on the mountain such as the Eagle's Nest corrie and some deep gullies and sharp arêtes in its east and northeastern faces that are popular with rock and winter climbers.
					As Ireland's highest mountain, Carrauntoohil is popular with mountain walkers, who most commonly ascend via the Devil's Ladder route; however, Carrauntoohil is also climbed as part of longer mountain walking routes in the MacGillycuddy's Reeks range, including the 15-kilometre (9+1⁄2 mi) Coomloughra Horseshoe or the 26-kilometre (16 mi) MacGillycuddy's Reeks Ridge Walk of the entire mountain range. Carrauntoohil, and most of the range, is held in private ownership and is not part of any Irish national park; however, reasonable access is granted to the public for recreational use.
				</p>
				<h5>Characteristics</h5>
				<p>Height: 1,039 meters<br/>
					Location: In the south west of Ireland, in County Kerry<br/>
					Length of a hike to the top:  12km or 7.5 miles (via Devil’s Ladder)<br/>
					Duration:  4 to 6 hours<br/>
					Difficulty level:  Challenging. Navigation skills and use of a map and compass are required. Inexperienced hikers are advised to hire a hiking guide or join a group hike.

				<h5>Different routes</h5>
			
			<!-- accordion (start) -->
				<div class="accordion">
					<!-- accordion section 1 -->
					<h1 id="accordionhead_1">1. Devil’s Ladder</h1>
					<div id="accordioncontent_1" class="accordion-content">
						The most popular route up to the top of Carrauntoohil is the so-called Devil’s Ladder, also known as the “Tourist Route”. But this route does includes all of the main highlights. The starting point for this route is Cronin’s Yard. From here, it goes after a river crossing through the extensive Hag’s Glen valley.
						The trail runs between two picturesque lakes and eventually takes you to the climb of Devil’s Ladder. The erosion of the trail can lead to falling rocks.So you should take hiking sticks with you.
					</div>

					<!-- accordion section 2 -->
					<h1 id="accordionhead_2">2. Brother O’Shea’s Gully</h1>
					<div id="accordioncontent_2" class="accordion-content">
						The Brother O’Shea’s Gully Route initially runs parallel to Devil’s Ladder. This variant is more lonely and in parts even steeper than the popular “Tourist Route”. Bear right before crossing the river at Hag’s Glen. Instead of walking between the lakes, you climb above the water.
						This will take you from the first, to the second and finally to a third level. Here you are on the shores of Cummeenoughter Lake, the highest lake in Ireland.
						Keep to the left where the path runs along the eponymous O’Shea Gorge. Steep cliffs lurk below Beenkeeragh Ridge, so be careful. Hikers on this route should be familiar with using a map, compass or GPS device.
					</div>

					<!-- accordion section 3 -->
					<h1 id="accordionhead_3">3. Coomloughra Horseshoe</h1>
					<div id="accordioncontent_3" class="accordion-content">
						This variant up to Carrauntoohil is the ultimate challenge. On the Coomloughra Horseshoe route you will climb various peaks and then you can boast of having climbed the three highest mountains in all of Ireland.
						The unmarked route runs here as a circular route along the mountain ridges that connect these peaks.
